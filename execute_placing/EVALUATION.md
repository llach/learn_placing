* optitrack is not perfect, sometimes rotation wabbles a bit
  * also sometimes markers can be occluded, thus not perfect
* FT only seem to try to straighten the gripper
  * sometimes that works
  * good example is the last pose where the object is nearly perfect but the sensor is nearly orthogonal to the table
* cylinder is tricky to place since it 
  * round
  * small surface area
  * top heavy
